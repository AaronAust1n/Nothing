# This file makes Python treat the directory `cosmic_pet_rock_simulator` as a package.
# It can be empty.

# Optionally, you can make classes available at the package level for easier imports, e.g.:
# from .pet_rock import QuantumEntangledPetRock
# from .quantum_universe import QuantumUniverseEngine
