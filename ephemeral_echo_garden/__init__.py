# This file makes Python treat the directory ephemeral_echo_garden as a package.

# You can selectively import classes/functions here to make them available
# when the package is imported, e.g.:
# from .garden import Garden
# from .linguistic_analyzer import LinguisticAnalyzer

# For now, leave it empty. Users of the package can import modules directly.
# e.g., from ephemeral_echo_garden.garden import Garden
pass
